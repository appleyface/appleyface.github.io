It's sometimes challenging to strike the right balance between doing things for myself versus for an audience. Maybe because there's not always a clear demarcation between the two. 

But regardless, recently Iâ€™ve been thinking that a personal website could function as an organized extension of the noodley mess of my brain. I used to be really bad about writing READMEs for computational projects and it really ate up a lot of time down the line (even though in the moment it was a timesaver to just keep code code coding). So this is an attempt to  apply that lesson in a more generic sense.
